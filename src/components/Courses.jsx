                    <p>
                        An immersive and collaborative series of programs rooted in problem solving, design thinking and software development, 
                        leveraging leading edge and innovative technologies.  
                        The objective is not only on knowledge uptake but more importantly focused on why new technologies matter, how they are 
                        shaping the world around us, and how you, the learner, can make your mark!

                                        This Impact Program features a deep dive into Blockchain technology and decentralized application(DApp) development, 
                                        and focuses on putting your knowledge to work!
                                        The delivery and assessment are based on knowledge, communication, collaboration and most importantly putting 
                                        it all into practise, or the application of this knowledge.

                                        The program is rooted in a specific problem or problems the learners are passionate about, these may vary from 
                                        derivatives of the UNâ€™s SDGs to internal business processes, of which they will have developed a solution for 
                                        by the end of the program!  Therefore, the program takes a novel approach in introducing the fundamentals of 
                                        Blockchain technology through designing and developing your very own solution.
